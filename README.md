# robinhood-node
Node app for calling Robinhood's private API. 

While this repo is only partially complete, in theory it is not hard to work out the remaning specifics given that the endpoints are already prepared. 
For future development: CLI/Web interface, finish writing API call methods, deal with weird encoding.
